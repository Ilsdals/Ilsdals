Call me Santi . he/him, straight . I'm 16+

I spend my majority sitting in ch area or near spawn

Anyone can interact with me, I always welcome company. If I dont respond or suddenly leave that means I'm afk

Please be respectful, I do not care if we are close friends. I am tired most of the time and donâ€™t have the energy to deal with bullshit, if I am uncomfortable I will simply just leave/not respond.

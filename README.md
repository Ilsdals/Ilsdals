Call me Santi . he/him . 7/22, 16+

I spend my majority sitting in ch area or near spawn

Please interact! I am very friendly. If I dont respond or suddenly leave that means I'm afk

Please be respectful, I do not care if we are close friends. I'm not the most energetic and donâ€™t feel like dealing with the disrespect, but I will still not allow myself to be belittled. If I am uncomfortable I will simply just leave/block/not respond so don't be surprised if I come off as rude
